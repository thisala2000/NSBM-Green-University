/*
In the given code, the instanceof operator is used to check the relationships between classes and their instances.
    m instanceof Animal checks if the object m is an instance of the Animal class. Since Mammal is a subclass of Animal, the output is true.
    d instanceof Mammal checks if the object d is an instance of the Mammal class. Since Dog is a subclass of Mammal, the output is true.
    d instanceof Animal checks if the object d is an instance of the Animal class. Since Dog is a subclass of Mammal, which in turn is a subclass of Animal, the output is true.
